Problem
A sequence of N numbers A [1], A [2],... , A [N]. When you perform a bubble sort on this sequence, write a program to determine how many times swap occurs.

Bubble sort is a method of sorting by swapping two adjacent numbers. For example, suppose the sequence was 3 2 1. In this case, since 3 and 2 adjacent to each other must be replaced, it becomes 2 3 1. Next, since 3 and 1 must change, it becomes 2 1 3. Next, since 2 and 1 must change, it becomes 1 2 3. The sort is then complete because no more changes are needed.

input
The first line is given by N (1≤N≤500,000). The next line contains N integers: A [1], A [2],… , A [N] is given. Each A [i] is in the range 0 ≦ | A [i] | ≦ 1,000,000,000.

Print
Print the swap count on the first line
